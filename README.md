Logic Circuits Final Project

### Task
We were asked to design and implement a system that receives instructions about a memory location, whose content must be sent to one of four output channels. The instructions about the channel to use and the memory address to access are provided via a single-bit serial input, while the system's outputs, the aforementioned channels, provide all the bits of the memory word in parallel.
